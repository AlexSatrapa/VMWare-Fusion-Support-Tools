# VMWare-Fusion-Support-Tools

A bunch of tools to help manage VMWare Fusion virtual machines.

These tools are well and truly obsolete, I highly recommend you consider Vagrant: http://www.vagrantup.com/

Vagrant & Puppet (or chef, or whatever) are much better at handling the scenarios I had envisaged such as setting up private networks, launching new VMs on the fly, and neatly handling the entire process without continual tinkering.

Even better than my tools, Vagrant doesn't fiddle with the host system and the configuration is one file that can be included in your project's source code as part of your SCM.
