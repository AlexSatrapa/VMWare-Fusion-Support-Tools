# Configuration file for ISC 2.0 vmnet-dhcpd operating on vmnet8.

# This file was automatically generated by the VMware configuration program.
# See Instructions below if you want to modify it.
#
# We set domain-name-servers to make some DHCP clients happy
# (dhclient as configured in SuSE, TurboLinux, etc.).
# We also supply a domain name to make pump (Red Hat 6.x) happy.
#

# vmnet1 is the Host-only network
# vmnet8 is the NAT network
